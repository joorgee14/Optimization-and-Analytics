# Optimization-and-Analytics

Final Grade: 8

The main topics covered in this course were:

- Introduction to the Modeling Process: Understanding the modeling steps involved in decision-making, along with an overview of different types of optimization and simulation models.

- Linear Models: Formulation, real-world applications, and solving linear programming problems using the simplex method, as well as interpreting the solutions.

- Discrete Models: Focus on applications involving binary variables, logical constraints, and the use of algorithms to solve discrete optimization problems.

- Nonlinear Models: Formulation of nonlinear programming problems, exploration of optimality conditions, and the application of machine learning algorithms to solve them.

Case Studies: Analysis of real-world business problems addressed through optimization and simulation models.

- Power Plant Production Optimization:
We developed a linear programming model to minimize the total cost of operating a network of power plants over three days, ensuring regional electricity demands were met while respecting production capacities and promoting renewable energy usage.

- Power Plant Production with Operational Decisions:
Building upon the initial model, we introduced binary decisions to determine whether each plant operates, incorporating emission constraints, renewable energy requirements, and mutual exclusion rules between plants, while maintaining cost minimization.

- Hub Location Problem in a Transportation Network:
We modeled a facility location problem where a distribution company selects optimal hubs to serve client nodes, minimizing operational and transportation costs while satisfying hub capacity limits and a maximum number of active hubs.

- Water Allocation for Agricultural Optimization:
We formulated an optimization model to distribute a fixed amount of water among agricultural parcels, aiming to maximize total crop yield while considering water costs and ensuring a fair and efficient allocation across all parcels
